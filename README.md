# monthly-spreadsheet
Collects and analyzes data written to a personal google-docs spreadsheet of mine regarding monthly payments.

Inspired by my getting lazy calculating what my roommate owes me every month.

## Installation:
A valid `clientSecret.json` file must exist in the `src/main/resources` directory. This is a OAuth 2.0 client secret json file created and downloaded from `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials`. For more information regarding the process, [see here](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).
